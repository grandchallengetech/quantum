# So you want to be a quantum computing star ...

## Do your homework

There is no getting around this part. You MUST become proficient with the following concepts and techniques:

* Linear Algebra
* Probability Theory
* Complex Numbers
* Trigonometry
* Logs & Exponentials

For the more advanced:

* Group Theory

```
$ give_me_math_super_powers.py
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Learn LA with code. Use Numpy etc.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="quantum.py" %}
```bash
# You got this
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
